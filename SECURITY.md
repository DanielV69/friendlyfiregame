# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest released version is supported.
Releases can be found on the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/friendlyfiregame/friendlyfiregame/releases).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since this game is a single player game that should *not* produce any network
traffic except for loading all assets necessary to play the game, we do not
expect many vulnerabilities at all. But since one can never be too sure about
such things, we would kindly ask to report any vulnerabilities by opening a
regular issue on the Github issue tracker *without* disclosing details about
the vulnerability. The development team will contact the reporter of any
security issues and offer a way of secure communications should the need arise.

(We know that that is a rather unusual attempt at managing security vulnerabilities)
